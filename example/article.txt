Donald Trump has complained about Chinese economic and military policy after a phone conversation with Taiwan's President drew the ire of Beijing. The President-elect's unusual call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday led to a diplomatic protest, although Vice President-elect Mike Pence played down its significance, saying it was a "courtesy", not intended to show a shift in US policy on China. "Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!" Mr Trump said on Twitter. China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei claim ownership of parts or all of the energy-rich South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually.
